🧙‍♂️ Wizsta (Prototype) - The Proxy Wizard in Training
Okay, so Wizsta isn’t fully grown yet, but it’s learning its proxy spells! 🪄 
This is a prototype of a rotating proxy browser extension—because who wants to get blocked while scraping, right?

🚀 What’s the Goal?
Rotating proxies like a boss (or at least try)
Keep web scraping and browsing smooth
Avoid getting caught in the “Access Denied” trap

⚠️ Disclaimer:
Still in the lab 🧪. Expect bugs, chaos, and occasional magic.

👀 Coming Soon:
More stability
Fancy UI (maybe)
Less breaking, more working
Stick around and watch Wizsta level up!
